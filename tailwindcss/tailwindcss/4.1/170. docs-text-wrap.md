Utilities for controlling how text wraps within an element.

## [Examples](#examples)

### [Allowing text to wrap](#allowing-text-to-wrap)

Use the `text-wrap` utility to wrap overflowing text onto multiple lines at logical points in the text:

Beloved Manhattan soup stand closes

New Yorkers are facing the winter chill with less warmth this year as the city's most revered soup stand unexpectedly shutters, following a series of events that have left the community puzzled.

    <article class="text-wrap">  <h3>Beloved Manhattan soup stand closes</h3>  <p>New Yorkers are facing the winter chill...</p></article>

### [Preventing text from wrapping](#preventing-text-from-wrapping)

Use the `text-nowrap` utility to prevent text from wrapping, allowing it to overflow if necessary:

    <article class="text-nowrap">  <h3>Beloved Manhattan soup stand closes</h3>  <p>New Yorkers are facing the winter chill...</p></article>

### [Balanced text wrapping](#balanced-text-wrapping)

Use the `text-balance` utility to distribute the text evenly across each line:

Beloved Manhattan soup stand closes

New Yorkers are facing the winter chill with less warmth this year as the city's most revered soup stand unexpectedly shutters, following a series of events that have left the community puzzled.

    <article>  <h3 class="text-balance">Beloved Manhattan soup stand closes</h3>  <p>New Yorkers are facing the winter chill...</p></article>

For performance reasons browsers limit text balancing to blocks that are ~6 lines or less, making it best suited for headings.

### [Pretty text wrapping](#pretty-text-wrapping)

Use the `text-pretty` utility to prevent orphans (a single word on its own line) at the end of a text block:

Beloved Manhattan soup stand closes

New Yorkers are facing the winter chill with less warmth this year as the city's most revered soup stand unexpectedly shutters, following a series of events that have left the community puzzled.

    <article>  <h3 class="text-pretty">Beloved Manhattan soup stand closes</h3>  <p>New Yorkers are facing the winter chill...</p></article>

### [Responsive design](#responsive-design)

Prefix a `text-wrap` utility with a breakpoint variant like `md:` to only apply the utility at medium screen sizes and above:

    <h1 class="text-pretty md:text-balance ...">  <!-- ... --></h1>

Learn more about using variants in the [variants documentation](/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states).
