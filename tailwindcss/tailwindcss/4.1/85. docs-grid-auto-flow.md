Utilities for controlling how elements in a grid are auto-placed.

## [Examples](#examples)

### [Basic example](#basic-example)

Use utilities like `grid-flow-col` and `grid-flow-row-dense` to control how the auto-placement algorithm works for a grid layout:

01

02

03

04

05

    <div class="grid grid-flow-row-dense grid-cols-3 grid-rows-3 ...">  <div class="col-span-2">01</div>  <div class="col-span-2">02</div>  <div>03</div>  <div>04</div>  <div>05</div></div>

### [Responsive design](#responsive-design)

Prefix a `grid-auto-flow` utility with a breakpoint variant like `md:` to only apply the utility at medium screen sizes and above:

    <div class="grid grid-flow-col md:grid-flow-row ...">  <!-- ... --></div>

Learn more about using variants in the [variants documentation](/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states).
