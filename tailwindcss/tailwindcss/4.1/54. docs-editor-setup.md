Tooling to improve the developer experience when working with Tailwind CSS.

## [Syntax support](#syntax-support)

Tailwind CSS uses custom CSS syntax like `@theme`, `@variant`, and `@source`, and in some editors this can trigger warnings or errors where these rules aren't recognized.

If you're using VS Code, our official [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) plugin includes a dedicated Tailwind CSS language mode that has support for all of the custom at-rules and functions Tailwind uses.

In some cases, you may need to disable native CSS linting/validations if your editor is very strict about the syntax it expects in your CSS files.

## [IntelliSense for VS Code](#intellisense-for-vs-code)

The official [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) extension for Visual Studio Code enhances the Tailwind development experience by providing users with advanced features such as autocomplete, syntax highlighting, and linting.

*   **Autocomplete** — providing intelligent suggestions for utility classes, as well as [CSS functions and directives](/docs/functions-and-directives).
*   **Linting** — highlighting errors and potential bugs in both your CSS and your markup.
*   **Hover previews** — revealing the complete CSS for utility classes when you hover over them.
*   **Syntax highlighting** — so that Tailwind features that use custom CSS syntax are highlighted correctly.

## [Class sorting with Prettier](#class-sorting-with-prettier)

We maintain an official [Prettier plugin](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss) for Tailwind CSS that automatically sorts your classes following our [recommended class order](about:/blog/automatic-class-sorting-with-prettier#how-classes-are-sorted).

It works seamlessly with custom Tailwind configurations, and because it’s just a Prettier plugin, it works anywhere Prettier works—including every popular editor and IDE, and of course on the command line.

HTML

    <!-- Before --><button class="text-white px-4 sm:px-8 py-2 sm:py-3 bg-sky-700 hover:bg-sky-800">Submit</button><!-- After --><button class="bg-sky-700 px-4 py-2 text-white hover:bg-sky-800 sm:px-8 sm:py-3">Submit</button>
