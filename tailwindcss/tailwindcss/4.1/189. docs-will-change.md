## will-change

Utilities for optimizing upcoming animations of elements that are expected to change.

## [Examples](#examples)

### [Optimizing with will change](#optimizing-with-will-change)

Use the `will-change-scroll`, `will-change-contents` and `will-change-transform` utilities to optimize an element that's expected to change in the near future by instructing the browser to prepare the necessary animation before it actually begins:

    <div class="overflow-auto will-change-scroll">  <!-- ... --></div>

It's recommended that you apply these utilities just before an element changes, and then remove it shortly after it finishes using `will-change-auto`.

The `will-change` property is intended to be used as a last resort when dealing with **known performance problems**. Avoid using these utilities too much, or simply in anticipation of performance issues, as it could actually cause the page to be less performant.

### [Using a custom value](#using-a-custom-value)

Use the `will-change-[<value>]` syntax to set the `will-change` property based on a completely custom value:

    <div class="will-change-[top,left] ...">  <!-- ... --></div>

For CSS variables, you can also use the `will-change-(<custom-property>)` syntax:

    <div class="will-change-(--my-properties) ...">  <!-- ... --></div>

This is just a shorthand for `will-change-[var(<custom-property>)]` that adds the `var()` function for you automatically.
