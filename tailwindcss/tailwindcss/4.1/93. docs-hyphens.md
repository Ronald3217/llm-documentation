Utilities for controlling how words should be hyphenated.

## [Examples](#examples)

### [Preventing hyphenation](#preventing-hyphenation)

Use the `hyphens-none` utility to prevent words from being hyphenated even if the line break suggestion `&shy;` is used:

Officially recognized by the Duden dictionary as the longest word in German, Kraftfahrzeug­haftpflichtversicherung is a 36 letter word for motor vehicle liability insurance.

    <p class="hyphens-none">  ... Kraftfahrzeug&shy;haftpflichtversicherung is a ...</p>

### [Manual hyphenation](#manual-hyphenation)

Use the `hyphens-manual` utility to only set hyphenation points where the line break suggestion `&shy;` is used:

Officially recognized by the Duden dictionary as the longest word in German, Kraftfahrzeug­haftpflichtversicherung is a 36 letter word for motor vehicle liability insurance.

    <p class="hyphens-manual">  ... Kraftfahrzeug&shy;haftpflichtversicherung is a ...</p>

This is the default browser behavior.

### [Automatic hyphenation](#automatic-hyphenation)

Use the `hyphens-auto` utility to allow the browser to automatically choose hyphenation points based on the language:

Officially recognized by the Duden dictionary as the longest word in German, Kraftfahrzeughaftpflichtversicherung is a 36 letter word for motor vehicle liability insurance.

    <p class="hyphens-auto" lang="de">  ... Kraftfahrzeughaftpflichtversicherung is a ...</p>

The line break suggestion `&shy;` will be preferred over automatic hyphenation points.

### [Responsive design](#responsive-design)

Prefix a `hyphens` utility with a breakpoint variant like `md:` to only apply the utility at medium screen sizes and above:

    <p class="hyphens-none md:hyphens-auto ...">  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...</p>

Learn more about using variants in the [variants documentation](/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states).
