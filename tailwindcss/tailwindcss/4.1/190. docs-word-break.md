Utilities for controlling word breaks in an element.

## [Examples](#examples)

### [Normal](#normal)

Use the `break-normal` utility to only add line breaks at normal word break points:

The longest word in any of the major English language dictionaries is pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis, a word that refers to a lung disease contracted from the inhalation of very fine silica particles, specifically from a volcano; medically, it is the same as silicosis.

    <p class="break-normal">The longest word in any of the major...</p>

### [Break All](#break-all)

Use the `break-all` utility to add line breaks whenever necessary, without trying to preserve whole words:

The longest word in any of the major English language dictionaries is pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis, a word that refers to a lung disease contracted from the inhalation of very fine silica particles, specifically from a volcano; medically, it is the same as silicosis.

    <p class="break-all">The longest word in any of the major...</p>

### [Break Keep](#break-keep)

Use the `break-keep` utility to prevent line breaks from being applied to Chinese/Japanese/Korean (CJK) text:

抗衡不屈不挠 (kànghéng bùqū bùnáo) 这是一个长词，意思是不畏强暴，奋勇抗争，坚定不移，永不放弃。这个词通常用来描述那些在面对困难和挑战时坚持自己信念的人， 他们克服一切困难，不屈不挠地追求自己的目标。无论遇到多大的挑战，他们都能够坚持到底，不放弃，最终获得胜利。

    <p class="break-keep">抗衡不屈不挠...</p>

For non-CJK text the `break-keep` utility has the same behavior as the `break-normal` utility.

### [Responsive design](#responsive-design)

Prefix a `word-break` utility with a breakpoint variant like `md:` to only apply the utility at medium screen sizes and above:

    <p class="break-normal md:break-all ...">  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...</p>

Learn more about using variants in the [variants documentation](/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states).
