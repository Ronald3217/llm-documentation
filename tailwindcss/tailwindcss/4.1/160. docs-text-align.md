Utilities for controlling the alignment of text.

## [Examples](#examples)

### [Left aligning text](#left-aligning-text)

Use the `text-left` utility to left align the text of an element:

So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made my way past the breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment, I _was_ a marine biologist.

    <p class="text-left">So I started to walk into the water...</p>

### [Right aligning text](#right-aligning-text)

Use the `text-right` utility to right align the text of an element:

So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made my way past the breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment, I _was_ a marine biologist.

    <p class="text-right">So I started to walk into the water...</p>

### [Centering text](#centering-text)

Use the `text-center` utility to center the text of an element:

So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made my way past the breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment, I _was_ a marine biologist.

    <p class="text-center">So I started to walk into the water...</p>

### [Justifying text](#justifying-text)

Use the `text-justify` utility to justify the text of an element:

So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made my way past the breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment, I _was_ a marine biologist.

    <p class="text-justify">So I started to walk into the water...</p>

### [Responsive design](#responsive-design)

Prefix a `text-align` utility with a breakpoint variant like `md:` to only apply the utility at medium screen sizes and above:

    <p class="text-left md:text-center ...">  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...</p>

Learn more about using variants in the [variants documentation](/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states).
