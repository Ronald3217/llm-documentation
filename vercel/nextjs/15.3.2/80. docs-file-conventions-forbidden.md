## forbidden.js

This feature is currently experimental and subject to change, it's not recommended for production. Try it out and share your feedback on [GitHub](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues).

The **forbidden** file is used to render UI when the [`forbidden`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/forbidden) function is invoked during authentication. Along with allowing you to customize the UI, Next.js will return a `403` status code.

app/forbidden.tsx

    import Link from 'next/link'
     
    export default function Forbidden() {
      return (
        <div>
          <h2>Forbidden</h2>
          <p>You are not authorized to access this resource.</p>
          <Link href="/">Return Home</Link>
        </div>
      )
    }
