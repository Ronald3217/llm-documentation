## Turbopack

Turbopack is an **incremental bundler** optimized for JavaScript and TypeScript, written in Rust, and built into **Next.js**. You can use Turbopack with both the Pages and App Router for a **much faster** local development experience.

## [Why Turbopack?](#why-turbopack)

We built Turbopack to push the performance of Next.js, including:

*   **Unified Graph:** Next.js supports multiple output environments (e.g., client and server). Managing multiple compilers and stitching bundles together can be tedious. Turbopack uses a **single, unified graph** for all environments.
*   **Bundling vs Native ESM:** Some tools skip bundling in development and rely on the browser's native ESM. This works well for small apps but can slow down large apps due to excessive network requests. Turbopack **bundles** in dev, but in an optimized way to keep large apps fast.
*   **Incremental Computation:** Turbopack parallelizes work across cores and **caches** results down to the function level. Once a piece of work is done, Turbopack won’t repeat it.
*   **Lazy Bundling:** Turbopack only bundles what is actually requested by the dev server. This lazy approach can reduce initial compile times and memory usage.

## [Getting started](#getting-started)

To enable Turbopack in your Next.js project, add the `--turbopack` flag to the `dev` and `build` scripts in your `package.json` file:

    {
      "scripts": {
        "dev": "next dev --turbopack",
        "build": "next build --turbopack",
        "start": "next start"
      }
    }

Currently, Turbopack for `dev` is stable, while `build` is in alpha. We are actively working on production support as Turbopack moves closer to stability.

## [Supported features](#supported-features)

Turbopack in Next.js has **zero-configuration** for the common use cases. Below is a summary of what is supported out of the box, plus some references to how you can configure Turbopack further when needed.

### [Language features](#language-features)

### [Framework and React features](#framework-and-react-features)

### [CSS and styling](#css-and-styling)

### [Assets](#assets)

### [Module resolution](#module-resolution)

### [Performance and Fast Refresh](#performance-and-fast-refresh)

## [Unsupported and unplanned features](#unsupported-and-unplanned-features)

Some features are not yet implemented or not planned:

*   **Legacy CSS Modules features**
    *   Standalone `:local` and `:global` pseudo-classes (only the function variant `:global(...)` is supported).
    *   The `@value` rule (superseded by CSS variables).
    *   `:import` and `:export` ICSS rules.
*   **`webpack()` configuration** in `next.config.js` Turbopack replaces webpack, so `webpack()` configs are not recognized. Use the [`turbopack` config](/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/turbopack) instead.
*   **AMP** Not planned for Turbopack support in Next.js.
*   **Yarn PnP** Not planned for Turbopack support in Next.js.
*   **`experimental.urlImports`** Not planned for Turbopack.
*   **`experimental.esmExternals`** Not planned. Turbopack does not support the legacy `esmExternals` configuration in Next.js.
*   **Some Next.js Experimental Flags**
    *   `experimental.typedRoutes`
    *   `experimental.nextScriptWorkers`
    *   `experimental.sri.algorithm`
    *   `experimental.fallbackNodePolyfills` We plan to implement these in the future.

For a full, detailed breakdown of each feature flag and its status, see the [Turbopack API Reference](/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/turbopack).

## [Configuration](#configuration)

Turbopack can be configured via `next.config.js` (or `next.config.ts`) under the `turbopack` key. Configuration options include:

*   **`rules`** Define additional [webpack loaders](about:/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/turbopack#configuring-webpack-loaders) for file transformations.
*   **`resolveAlias`** Create manual aliases (like `resolve.alias` in webpack).
*   **`resolveExtensions`** Change or extend file extensions for module resolution.
*   **`moduleIds`** Set how module IDs are generated (`'named'` vs `'deterministic'`).
*   **`treeShaking`** Enable or disable tree shaking in dev and future production builds.
*   **`memoryLimit`** Set a memory limit (in bytes) for Turbopack.

    module.exports = {
      turbopack: {
        // Example: adding an alias and custom file extension
        resolveAlias: {
          underscore: 'lodash',
        },
        resolveExtensions: ['.mdx', '.tsx', '.ts', '.jsx', '.js', '.json'],
      },
    }

For more in-depth configuration examples, see the [Turbopack config documentation](/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/turbopack).

## [Generating trace files for performance debugging](#generating-trace-files-for-performance-debugging)

If you encounter performance or memory issues and want to help the Next.js team diagnose them, you can generate a trace file by appending `NEXT_TURBOPACK_TRACING=1` to your dev command:

    NEXT_TURBOPACK_TRACING=1 next dev --turbopack

This will produce a `.next/trace-turbopack` file. Include that file when creating a GitHub issue on the [Next.js repo](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) to help us investigate.

## [Summary](#summary)

Turbopack is a **Rust-based**, **incremental** bundler designed to make local development and builds fast—especially for large applications. It is integrated into Next.js, offering zero-config CSS, React, and TypeScript support.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to improve Turbopack and add production build support. In the meantime, give it a try with `next dev --turbopack` and let us know your feedback.
