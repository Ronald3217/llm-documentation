## Project structure and organization

This page provides an overview of **all** the folder and file conventions in Next.js, and recommendations for organizing your project.

## [Folder and file conventions](#folder-and-file-conventions)

### [Top-level folders](#top-level-folders)

Top-level folders are used to organize your application's code and static assets.

![Route segments to path segments](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Ftop-level-folders.png&w=3840&q=75)![Route segments to path segments](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Fdark%2Ftop-level-folders.png&w=3840&q=75)

### [Top-level files](#top-level-files)

Top-level files are used to configure your application, manage dependencies, run middleware, integrate monitoring tools, and define environment variables.

### [Routing Files](#routing-files)

### [Nested routes](#nested-routes)

### [Dynamic routes](#dynamic-routes)

### [Route Groups and private folders](#route-groups-and-private-folders)

### [Parallel and Intercepted Routes](#parallel-and-intercepted-routes)

### [Metadata file conventions](#metadata-file-conventions)

#### [App icons](#app-icons)

#### [Open Graph and Twitter images](#open-graph-and-twitter-images)

#### [SEO](#seo)

## [Organizing your project](#organizing-your-project)

Next.js is **unopinionated** about how you organize and colocate your project files. But it does provide several features to help you organize your project.

### [Component hierarchy](#component-hierarchy)

The components defined in special files are rendered in a specific hierarchy:

*   `layout.js`
*   `template.js`
*   `error.js` (React error boundary)
*   `loading.js` (React suspense boundary)
*   `not-found.js` (React error boundary)
*   `page.js` or nested `layout.js`

![Component Hierarchy for File Conventions](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Ffile-conventions-component-hierarchy.png&w=3840&q=75)![Component Hierarchy for File Conventions](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Fdark%2Ffile-conventions-component-hierarchy.png&w=3840&q=75)

The components are rendered recursively in nested routes, meaning the components of a route segment will be nested **inside** the components of its parent segment.

![Nested File Conventions Component Hierarchy](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Fnested-file-conventions-component-hierarchy.png&w=3840&q=75)![Nested File Conventions Component Hierarchy](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Fdark%2Fnested-file-conventions-component-hierarchy.png&w=3840&q=75)

### [Colocation](#colocation)

In the `app` directory, nested folders define route structure. Each folder represents a route segment that is mapped to a corresponding segment in a URL path.

However, even though route structure is defined through folders, a route is **not publicly accessible** until a `page.js` or `route.js` file is added to a route segment.

![A diagram showing how a route is not publicly accessible until a page.js or route.js file is added to a route segment.](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Fproject-organization-not-routable.png&w=3840&q=75)![A diagram showing how a route is not publicly accessible until a page.js or route.js file is added to a route segment.](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Fdark%2Fproject-organization-not-routable.png&w=3840&q=75)

And, even when a route is made publicly accessible, only the **content returned** by `page.js` or `route.js` is sent to the client.

![A diagram showing how page.js and route.js files make routes publicly accessible.](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Fproject-organization-routable.png&w=3840&q=75)![A diagram showing how page.js and route.js files make routes publicly accessible.](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Fdark%2Fproject-organization-routable.png&w=3840&q=75)

This means that **project files** can be **safely colocated** inside route segments in the `app` directory without accidentally being routable.

![A diagram showing colocated project files are not routable even when a segment contains a page.js or route.js file.](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Fproject-organization-colocation.png&w=3840&q=75)![A diagram showing colocated project files are not routable even when a segment contains a page.js or route.js file.](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Fdark%2Fproject-organization-colocation.png&w=3840&q=75)

> **Good to know**: While you **can** colocate your project files in `app` you don't **have** to. If you prefer, you can [keep them outside the `app` directory](#store-project-files-outside-of-app).

### [Private folders](#private-folders)

Private folders can be created by prefixing a folder with an underscore: `_folderName`

This indicates the folder is a private implementation detail and should not be considered by the routing system, thereby **opting the folder and all its subfolders** out of routing.

![An example folder structure using private folders](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Fproject-organization-private-folders.png&w=3840&q=75)![An example folder structure using private folders](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Fdark%2Fproject-organization-private-folders.png&w=3840&q=75)

Since files in the `app` directory can be [safely colocated by default](#colocation), private folders are not required for colocation. However, they can be useful for:

*   Separating UI logic from routing logic.
*   Consistently organizing internal files across a project and the Next.js ecosystem.
*   Sorting and grouping files in code editors.
*   Avoiding potential naming conflicts with future Next.js file conventions.

> **Good to know**:
> 
> *   While not a framework convention, you might also consider marking files outside private folders as "private" using the same underscore pattern.
> *   You can create URL segments that start with an underscore by prefixing the folder name with `%5F` (the URL-encoded form of an underscore): `%5FfolderName`.
> *   If you don't use private folders, it would be helpful to know Next.js [special file conventions](about:/docs/app/getting-started/project-structure#routing-files) to prevent unexpected naming conflicts.

### [Route groups](#route-groups)

Route groups can be created by wrapping a folder in parenthesis: `(folderName)`

This indicates the folder is for organizational purposes and should **not be included** in the route's URL path.

![An example folder structure using route groups](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Fproject-organization-route-groups.png&w=3840&q=75)![An example folder structure using route groups](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Fdark%2Fproject-organization-route-groups.png&w=3840&q=75)

Route groups are useful for:

*   Organizing routes by site section, intent, or team. e.g. marketing pages, admin pages, etc.
*   Enabling nested layouts in the same route segment level:
    *   [Creating multiple nested layouts in the same segment, including multiple root layouts](#creating-multiple-root-layouts)
    *   [Adding a layout to a subset of routes in a common segment](#opting-specific-segments-into-a-layout)

### [`src` folder](#src-folder)

Next.js supports storing application code (including `app`) inside an optional [`src` folder](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/src-folder). This separates application code from project configuration files which mostly live in the root of a project.

![An example folder structure with the `src` folder](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Fproject-organization-src-directory.png&w=3840&q=75)![An example folder structure with the `src` folder](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Fdark%2Fproject-organization-src-directory.png&w=3840&q=75)

## [Examples](#examples)

The following section lists a very high-level overview of common strategies. The simplest takeaway is to choose a strategy that works for you and your team and be consistent across the project.

> **Good to know**: In our examples below, we're using `components` and `lib` folders as generalized placeholders, their naming has no special framework significance and your projects might use other folders like `ui`, `utils`, `hooks`, `styles`, etc.

### [Store project files outside of `app`](#store-project-files-outside-of-app)

This strategy stores all application code in shared folders in the **root of your project** and keeps the `app` directory purely for routing purposes.

![An example folder structure with project files outside of app](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Fproject-organization-project-root.png&w=3840&q=75)![An example folder structure with project files outside of app](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Fdark%2Fproject-organization-project-root.png&w=3840&q=75)

### [Store project files in top-level folders inside of `app`](#store-project-files-in-top-level-folders-inside-of-app)

This strategy stores all application code in shared folders in the **root of the `app` directory**.

![An example folder structure with project files inside app](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Fproject-organization-app-root.png&w=3840&q=75)![An example folder structure with project files inside app](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Fdark%2Fproject-organization-app-root.png&w=3840&q=75)

### [Split project files by feature or route](#split-project-files-by-feature-or-route)

This strategy stores globally shared application code in the root `app` directory and **splits** more specific application code into the route segments that use them.

![An example folder structure with project files split by feature or route](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Fproject-organization-app-root-split.png&w=3840&q=75)![An example folder structure with project files split by feature or route](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Fdark%2Fproject-organization-app-root-split.png&w=3840&q=75)

### [Organize routes without affecting the URL path](#organize-routes-without-affecting-the-url-path)

To organize routes without affecting the URL, create a group to keep related routes together. The folders in parenthesis will be omitted from the URL (e.g. `(marketing)` or `(shop)`).

![Organizing Routes with Route Groups](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Froute-group-organisation.png&w=3840&q=75)![Organizing Routes with Route Groups](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Fdark%2Froute-group-organisation.png&w=3840&q=75)

Even though routes inside `(marketing)` and `(shop)` share the same URL hierarchy, you can create a different layout for each group by adding a `layout.js` file inside their folders.

![Route Groups with Multiple Layouts](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Froute-group-multiple-layouts.png&w=3840&q=75)![Route Groups with Multiple Layouts](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Fdark%2Froute-group-multiple-layouts.png&w=3840&q=75)

### [Opting specific segments into a layout](#opting-specific-segments-into-a-layout)

To opt specific routes into a layout, create a new route group (e.g. `(shop)`) and move the routes that share the same layout into the group (e.g. `account` and `cart`). The routes outside of the group will not share the layout (e.g. `checkout`).

![Route Groups with Opt-in Layouts](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Froute-group-opt-in-layouts.png&w=3840&q=75)![Route Groups with Opt-in Layouts](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Fdark%2Froute-group-opt-in-layouts.png&w=3840&q=75)

### [Opting for loading skeletons on a specific route](#opting-for-loading-skeletons-on-a-specific-route)

To apply a [loading skeleton](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming) via a `loading.js` file to a specific route, create a new route group (e.g., `/(overview)`) and then move your `loading.tsx` inside that route group.

![Folder structure showing a loading.tsx and a page.tsx inside the route group](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Froute-group-loading.png&w=3840&q=75)![Folder structure showing a loading.tsx and a page.tsx inside the route group](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Fdark%2Froute-group-loading.png&w=3840&q=75)

Now, the `loading.tsx` file will only apply to your dashboard → overview page instead of all your dashboard pages without affecting the URL path structure.

### [Creating multiple root layouts](#creating-multiple-root-layouts)

To create multiple [root layouts](about:/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/layout#root-layouts), remove the top-level `layout.js` file, and add a `layout.js` file inside each route group. This is useful for partitioning an application into sections that have a completely different UI or experience. The `<html>` and `<body>` tags need to be added to each root layout.

![Route Groups with Multiple Root Layouts](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Froute-group-multiple-root-layouts.png&w=3840&q=75)![Route Groups with Multiple Root Layouts](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Fdark%2Froute-group-multiple-root-layouts.png&w=3840&q=75)

In the example above, both `(marketing)` and `(shop)` have their own root layout.
