## useCache

This feature is currently available in the canary channel and subject to change. Try it out by [upgrading Next.js](/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/canary), and share your feedback on [GitHub](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues).

The `useCache` flag is an experimental feature in Next.js that enables the [`use cache` directive](/docs/app/api-reference/directives/use-cache) to be used independently of [`dynamicIO`](/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/dynamicIO). When enabled, you can use `use cache` in your application even if `dynamicIO` is turned off.

## [Usage](#usage)

To enable the `useCache` flag, set it to `true` in the `experimental` section of your `next.config.ts` file:

next.config.ts

    import type { NextConfig } from 'next'
     
    const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
      experimental: {
        useCache: true,
      },
    }
     
    export default nextConfig

When `useCache` is enabled, you can use the following cache functions and configurations:

*   The [`use cache` directive](/docs/app/api-reference/directives/use-cache)
*   The [`cacheLife` function](/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/cacheLife) with `use cache`
*   The [`cacheTag` function](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cacheTag)
