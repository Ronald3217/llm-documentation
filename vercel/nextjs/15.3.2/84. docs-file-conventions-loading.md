> A loading file can create instant loading states built on Suspense.

| Version | Changes             |
| ------- | ------------------- |
| v13.0.0 | loading introduced. |

## loading.js

A **loading** file can create instant loading states built on [Suspense](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming).

By default, this file is a [Server Component](/docs/app/getting-started/server-and-client-components) - but can also be used as a Client Component through the `"use client"` directive.

app/feed/loading.tsx

    export default function Loading() {
      // Or a custom loading skeleton component
      return <p>Loading...</p>
    }

Loading UI components do not accept any parameters.

> **Good to know**:
> 
> *   While designing loading UI, you may find it helpful to use the [React Developer Tools](https://react.dev/learn/react-developer-tools) to manually toggle Suspense boundaries.
