## staticGeneration\*

This feature is currently experimental and subject to change, it's not recommended for production. Try it out and share your feedback on [GitHub](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues).

The `staticGeneration*` options allow you to configure the Static Generation process for advanced use cases.

next.config.ts

    import type { NextConfig } from 'next'
     
    const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
      experimental: {
        staticGenerationRetryCount: 1,
        staticGenerationMaxConcurrency: 8,
        staticGenerationMinPagesPerWorker: 25,
      },
    }
     
    export default nextConfig

## [Config Options](#config-options)

The following options are available:

*   `staticGenerationRetryCount`: The number of times to retry a failed page generation before failing the build.
*   `staticGenerationMaxConcurrency`: The maximum number of pages to be processed per worker.
*   `staticGenerationMinPagesPerWorker`: The minimum number of pages to be processed before starting a new worker.
