# Create a new Next.js application

> Before you begin, make sure your system meets the following requirements:



## [System requirements](#system-requirements)

Before you begin, make sure your system meets the following requirements:

*   [Node.js 18.18](https://nodejs.org/) or later.
*   macOS, Windows (including WSL), or Linux.

## [Automatic installation](#automatic-installation)

The quickest way to create a new Next.js app is using [`create-next-app`](/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app), which sets up everything automatically for you. To create a project, run:

    npx create-next-app@latest

On installation, you'll see the following prompts:

    What is your project named? my-app
    Would you like to use TypeScript? No / Yes
    Would you like to use ESLint? No / Yes
    Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? No / Yes
    Would you like your code inside a `src/` directory? No / Yes
    Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) No / Yes
    Would you like to use Turbopack for `next dev`?  No / Yes
    Would you like to customize the import alias (`@/*` by default)? No / Yes
    What import alias would you like configured? @/*

After the prompts, [`create-next-app`](/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app) will create a folder with your project name and install the required dependencies.

## [Manual installation](#manual-installation)

To manually create a new Next.js app, install the required packages:

    npm install next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest

Then, add the following scripts to your `package.json` file:

    {
      "scripts": {
        "dev": "next dev",
        "build": "next build",
        "start": "next start",
        "lint": "next lint"
      }
    }

These scripts refer to the different stages of developing an application:

*   `next dev`: Starts the development server.
*   `next build`: Builds the application for production.
*   `next start`: Starts the production server.
*   `next lint`: Runs ESLint.

### [Create the `pages` directory](#create-the-pages-directory)

Next.js uses file-system routing, which means the routes in your application are determined by how you structure your files.

Create a `pages` directory at the root of your project. Then, add an `index.tsx` file inside your `pages` folder. This will be your home page (`/`):

    export default function Page() {
      return <h1>Hello, Next.js!</h1>
    }

Next, add an `_app.tsx` file inside `pages/` to define the global layout. Learn more about the [custom App file](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-app).

    import type { AppProps } from 'next/app'
     
    export default function App({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
      return <Component {...pageProps} />
    }

Finally, add a `_document.tsx` file inside `pages/` to control the initial response from the server. Learn more about the [custom Document file](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-document).

    import { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document'
     
    export default function Document() {
      return (
        <Html>
          <Head />
          <body>
            <Main />
            <NextScript />
          </body>
        </Html>
      )
    }

### [Create the `public` folder (optional)](#create-the-public-folder-optional)

Create a [`public` folder](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/public-folder) at the root of your project to store static assets such as images, fonts, etc. Files inside `public` can then be referenced by your code starting from the base URL (`/`).

You can then reference these assets using the root path (`/`). For example, `public/profile.png` can be referenced as `/profile.png`:

    import Image from 'next/image'
     
    export default function Page() {
      return <Image src="/profile.png" alt="Profile" width={100} height={100} />
    }

## [Run the development server](#run-the-development-server)

1.  Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
2.  Visit `http://localhost:3000` to view your application.
3.  Edit the `pages/index.tsx` file and save it to see the updated result in your browser.

## [Set up TypeScript](#set-up-typescript)

> Minimum TypeScript version: `v4.5.2`

Next.js comes with built-in TypeScript support. To add TypeScript to your project, rename a file to `.ts` / `.tsx` and run `next dev`. Next.js will automatically install the necessary dependencies and add a `tsconfig.json` file with the recommended config options.

See the [TypeScript reference](/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/typescript) page for more information.

## [Set up ESLint](#set-up-eslint)

Next.js comes with built-in ESLint. It automatically installs the necessary packages and configures the proper settings when you create a new project with `create-next-app`.

To manually add ESLint to an existing project, add `next lint` as a script to `package.json`:

    {
      "scripts": {
        "lint": "next lint"
      }
    }

Then, run `npm run lint` and you will be guided through the installation and configuration process.

    npm run lint

You'll see a prompt like this:

> ? How would you like to configure ESLint?
> 
> ❯ Strict (recommended)  
> Base  
> Cancel

*   **Strict**: Includes Next.js' base ESLint configuration along with a stricter Core Web Vitals rule-set. This is the recommended configuration for developers setting up ESLint for the first time.
*   **Base**: Includes Next.js' base ESLint configuration.
*   **Cancel**: Skip configuration. Select this option if you plan on setting up your own custom ESLint configuration.

If `Strict` or `Base` are selected, Next.js will automatically install `eslint` and `eslint-config-next` as dependencies in your application and create an `.eslintrc.json` file in the root of your project that includes your selected configuration.

You can now run `next lint` every time you want to run ESLint to catch errors. Once ESLint has been set up, it will also automatically run during every build (`next build`). Errors will fail the build, while warnings will not.

See the [ESLint Plugin](/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/eslint) page for more information.

## [Set up Absolute Imports and Module Path Aliases](#set-up-absolute-imports-and-module-path-aliases)

Next.js has in-built support for the `"paths"` and `"baseUrl"` options of `tsconfig.json` and `jsconfig.json` files.

These options allow you to alias project directories to absolute paths, making it easier and cleaner to import modules. For example:

    // Before
    import { Button } from '../../../components/button'
     
    // After
    import { Button } from '@/components/button'

To configure absolute imports, add the `baseUrl` configuration option to your `tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json` file. For example:

    {
      "compilerOptions": {
        "baseUrl": "src/"
      }
    }

In addition to configuring the `baseUrl` path, you can use the `"paths"` option to `"alias"` module paths.

For example, the following configuration maps `@/components/*` to `components/*`:

    {
      "compilerOptions": {
        "baseUrl": "src/",
        "paths": {
          "@/styles/*": ["styles/*"],
          "@/components/*": ["components/*"]
        }
      }
    }

Each of the `"paths"` are relative to the `baseUrl` location.
