## authInterrupts

This feature is currently available in the canary channel and subject to change. Try it out by [upgrading Next.js](/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/canary), and share your feedback on [GitHub](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues).

The `authInterrupts` configuration option allows you to use [`forbidden`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/forbidden) and [`unauthorized`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/unauthorized) APIs in your application. While these functions are experimental, you must enable the `authInterrupts` option in your `next.config.js` file to use them:

next.config.ts

    import type { NextConfig } from 'next'
     
    const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
      experimental: {
        authInterrupts: true,
      },
    }
     
    export default nextConfig
