# How to implement JSON-LD in your Next.js application

> JSON-LD is a format for structured data that can be used by search engines and AI to to help them understand the structure of the page beyond pure content. For example, you can use it to describe a person, an event, an organization, a movie, a book, a recipe, and many other types of entities.



[JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/) is a format for structured data that can be used by search engines and AI to to help them understand the structure of the page beyond pure content. For example, you can use it to describe a person, an event, an organization, a movie, a book, a recipe, and many other types of entities.

Our current recommendation for JSON-LD is to render structured data as a `<script>` tag in your `layout.js` or `page.js` components. For example:

    export default async function Page({ params }) {
      const { id } = await params
      const product = await getProduct(id)
     
      const jsonLd = {
        '@context': 'https://schema.org',
        '@type': 'Product',
        name: product.name,
        image: product.image,
        description: product.description,
      }
     
      return (
        <section>
          {/* Add JSON-LD to your page */}
          <script
            type="application/ld+json"
            dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: JSON.stringify(jsonLd) }}
          />
          {/* ... */}
        </section>
      )
    }

You can validate and test your structured data with the [Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results) for Google or the generic [Schema Markup Validator](https://validator.schema.org/).

You can type your JSON-LD with TypeScript using community packages like [`schema-dts`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/schema-dts):

    import { Product, WithContext } from 'schema-dts'
     
    const jsonLd: WithContext<Product> = {
      '@context': 'https://schema.org',
      '@type': 'Product',
      name: 'Next.js Sticker',
      image: 'https://nextjs.org/imgs/sticker.png',
      description: 'Dynamic at the speed of static.',
    }
