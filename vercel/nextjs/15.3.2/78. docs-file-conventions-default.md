## default.js

The `default.js` file is used to render a fallback within [Parallel Routes](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/parallel-routes) when Next.js cannot recover a [slot's](about:/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/parallel-routes#slots) active state after a full-page load.

During [soft navigation](about:/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/linking-and-navigating#5-soft-navigation), Next.js keeps track of the active _state_ (subpage) for each slot. However, for hard navigations (full-page load), Next.js cannot recover the active state. In this case, a `default.js` file can be rendered for subpages that don't match the current URL.

Consider the following folder structure. The `@team` slot has a `settings` page, but `@analytics` does not.

When navigating to `/settings`, the `@team` slot will render the `settings` page while maintaining the currently active page for the `@analytics` slot.

On refresh, Next.js will render a `default.js` for `@analytics`. If `default.js` doesn't exist, a `404` is rendered instead.

Additionally, since `children` is an implicit slot, you also need to create a `default.js` file to render a fallback for `children` when Next.js cannot recover the active state of the parent page.

### [`params` (optional)](#params-optional)

A promise that resolves to an object containing the [dynamic route parameters](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes) from the root segment down to the slot's subpages. For example:

    export default async function Default({
      params,
    }: {
      params: Promise<{ artist: string }>
    }) {
      const { artist } = await params
    }

*   Since the `params` prop is a promise. You must use `async/await` or React's [`use`](https://react.dev/reference/react/use) function to access the values.
    *   In version 14 and earlier, `params` was a synchronous prop. To help with backwards compatibility, you can still access it synchronously in Next.js 15, but this behavior will be deprecated in the future.
