# Installation

## Introduction

Most projects start with a template. Let's use a basic template maintained by React Router:

    npx create-react-router@latest my-react-router-app

Now change into the new directory and start the app

    cd my-react-router-app
    npm i
    npm run dev

You can now open your browser to `http://localhost:5173`

You can [view the template on GitHub](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router-templates/tree/main/default) to see how to manually set up your project.

We also have a number of [ready to deploy templates](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router-templates) available for you to get started with:

    npx create-react-router@latest --template remix-run/react-router-templates/<template-name>
