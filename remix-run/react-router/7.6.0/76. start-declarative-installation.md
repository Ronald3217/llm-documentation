# Installation

## Introduction

You can start with a React template from Vite and choose "React", otherwise bootstrap your application however you prefer.

    npx create-vite@latest

Next install React Router from npm:

    npm i react-router

Finally, render a `<BrowserRouter>` around your application:

    import React from "react";
    import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
    import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router";
    import App from "./app";

    const root = document.getElementById("root");

    ReactDOM.createRoot(root).render(
      <BrowserRouter>
        <App />
      </BrowserRouter>
    );
