# Security

This is by no means a comprehensive guide, but React Router provides features to help address a few aspects under the _very large_ umbrella that is _Security_.

## `Content-Security-Policy`

If you are implementing a [Content-Security-Policy (CSP)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CSP) in your application, specifically one using the `unsafe-inline` directive, you will need to specify a [`nonce`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/nonce) attribute on the inline `<script>` elements rendered in your HTML. This must be specified on any API that generates inline scripts, including:

- [`<Scripts nonce>`](../api/components/Scripts) (`root.tsx`)
- [`<ScrollRestoration nonce>`](../api/components/ScrollRestoration) (`root.tsx`)
- [`<ServerRouter nonce>`](../api/components/ServerRouter) (`entry.server.tsx`)
- [`renderToPipeableStream(..., { nonce })`](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/server/renderToPipeableStream) (`entry.server.tsx`)
- [`renderToReadableStream(..., { nonce })`](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/server/renderToReadableStream) (`entry.server.tsx`)
