# Data Loading

## Providing Data

Data is provided to route components from route loaders:

    createBrowserRouter([
      {
        path: "/",
        loader: async () => {
          // return data from here
          return { records: await getSomeRecords() };
        },
        Component: MyRoute,
      },
    ]);

## Accessing Data

The data is available in route components with `useLoaderData`.

    import { useLoaderData } from "react-router";

    function MyRoute() {
      const { records } = useLoaderData();
      return <div>{records.length}</div>;
    }

As the user navigates between routes, the loaders are called before the route component is rendered.
