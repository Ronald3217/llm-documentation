> The built-in browser <meta> component lets you add metadata to the document.



The [built-in browser `<meta>` component](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta) lets you add metadata to the document.

    <meta name="keywords" content="React, JavaScript, semantic markup, html" />

## Reference[](#reference "Link for Reference")

### `<meta>`[](#meta "Link for this heading")

To add document metadata, render the [built-in browser `<meta>` component](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta). You can render `<meta>` from any component and React will always place the corresponding DOM element in the document head.

    <meta name="keywords" content="React, JavaScript, semantic markup, html" />

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Props[](#props "Link for Props")

`<meta>` supports all [common element props.](about:/reference/react-dom/components/common#props)

It should have _exactly one_ of the following props: `name`, `httpEquiv`, `charset`, `itemProp`. The `<meta>` component does something different depending on which of these props is specified.

*   `name`: a string. Specifies the [kind of metadata](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta/name) to be attached to the document.
*   `charset`: a string. Specifies the character set used by the document. The only valid value is `"utf-8"`.
*   `httpEquiv`: a string. Specifies a directive for processing the document.
*   `itemProp`: a string. Specifies metadata about a particular item within the document rather than the document as a whole.
*   `content`: a string. Specifies the metadata to be attached when used with the `name` or `itemProp` props or the behavior of the directive when used with the `httpEquiv` prop.

#### Special rendering behavior[](#special-rendering-behavior "Link for Special rendering behavior")

React will always place the DOM element corresponding to the `<meta>` component within the document’s `<head>`, regardless of where in the React tree it is rendered. The `<head>` is the only valid place for `<meta>` to exist within the DOM, yet it’s convenient and keeps things composable if a component representing a specific page can render `<meta>` components itself.

There is one exception to this: if `<meta>` has an [`itemProp`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/itemprop) prop, there is no special behavior, because in this case it doesn’t represent metadata about the document but rather metadata about a specific part of the page.

## Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage")

### Annotating the document with metadata[](#annotating-the-document-with-metadata "Link for Annotating the document with metadata")

You can annotate the document with metadata such as keywords, a summary, or the author’s name. React will place this metadata within the document `<head>` regardless of where in the React tree it is rendered.

    <meta name="author" content="John Smith" /><meta name="keywords" content="React, JavaScript, semantic markup, html" /><meta name="description" content="API reference for the <meta> component in React DOM" />

You can render the `<meta>` component from any component. React will put a `<meta>` DOM node in the document `<head>`.

### Annotating specific items within the document with metadata[](#annotating-specific-items-within-the-document-with-metadata "Link for Annotating specific items within the document with metadata")

You can use the `<meta>` component with the `itemProp` prop to annotate specific items within the document with metadata. In this case, React will _not_ place these annotations within the document `<head>` but will place them like any other React component.

    <section itemScope><h3>Annotating specific items</h3><meta itemProp="description" content="API reference for using <meta> with itemProp" /><p>...</p></section>
