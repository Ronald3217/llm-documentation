## Referencing values with refs[](#referencing-values-with-refs "Link for Referencing values with refs")

When you want a component to ‚Äúremember‚Äù some information, but you don‚Äôt want that information to [trigger new renders](/learn/render-and-commit), you can use a _ref_:

    const ref = useRef(0);

Like state, refs are retained by React between re-renders. However, setting state re-renders a component. Changing a ref does not! You can access the current value of that ref through the `ref.current` property.

import { useRef } from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
  let ref = useRef(0);

  function handleClick() {
    ref.current = ref.current + 1;
    alert('You clicked ' + ref.current + ' times!');
  }

  return (
    <button onClick\={handleClick}\>
      Click me!
    </button\>
  );
}

A ref is like a secret pocket of your component that React doesn‚Äôt track. For example, you can use refs to store [timeout IDs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/setTimeout#return_value), [DOM elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element), and other objects that don‚Äôt impact the component‚Äôs rendering output.

* * *

## Manipulating the DOM with refs[](#manipulating-the-dom-with-refs "Link for Manipulating the DOM with refs")

React automatically updates the DOM to match your render output, so your components won‚Äôt often need to manipulate it. However, sometimes you might need access to the DOM elements managed by React‚Äîfor example, to focus a node, scroll to it, or measure its size and position. There is no built-in way to do those things in React, so you will need a ref to the DOM node. For example, clicking the button will focus the input using a ref:

import { useRef } from 'react';

export default function Form() {
  const inputRef = useRef(null);

  function handleClick() {
    inputRef.current.focus();
  }

  return (
    <\>
      <input ref\={inputRef} />
      <button onClick\={handleClick}\>
        Focus the input
      </button\>
    </\>
  );
}

## Synchronizing with Effects[](#synchronizing-with-effects "Link for Synchronizing with Effects")

Some components need to synchronize with external systems. For example, you might want to control a non-React component based on the React state, set up a server connection, or send an analytics log when a component appears on the screen. Unlike event handlers, which let you handle particular events, _Effects_ let you run some code after rendering. Use them to synchronize your component with a system outside of React.

Press Play/Pause a few times and see how the video player stays synchronized to the `isPlaying` prop value:

import { useState, useRef, useEffect } from 'react';

function VideoPlayer({ src, isPlaying }) {
  const ref = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() \=> {
    if (isPlaying) {
      ref.current.play();
    } else {
      ref.current.pause();
    }
  }, \[isPlaying\]);

  return <video ref\={ref} src\={src} loop playsInline />;
}

export default function App() {
  const \[isPlaying, setIsPlaying\] = useState(false);
  return (
    <\>
      <button onClick\={() \=> setIsPlaying(!isPlaying)}\>
        {isPlaying ? 'Pause' : 'Play'}
      </button\>
      <VideoPlayer
        isPlaying\={isPlaying}
        src\="https://interactive-examples.mdn.mozilla.net/media/cc0-videos/flower.mp4"
      />
    </\>
  );
}

Many Effects also ‚Äúclean up‚Äù after themselves. For example, an Effect that sets up a connection to a chat server should return a _cleanup function_ that tells React how to disconnect your component from that server:

In development, React will immediately run and clean up your Effect one extra time. This is why you see `"‚úÖ Connecting..."` printed twice. This ensures that you don‚Äôt forget to implement the cleanup function.

* * *

## You Might Not Need An Effect[](#you-might-not-need-an-effect "Link for You Might Not Need An Effect")

Effects are an escape hatch from the React paradigm. They let you ‚Äústep outside‚Äù of React and synchronize your components with some external system. If there is no external system involved (for example, if you want to update a component‚Äôs state when some props or state change), you shouldn‚Äôt need an Effect. Removing unnecessary Effects will make your code easier to follow, faster to run, and less error-prone.

There are two common cases in which you don‚Äôt need Effects:

*   **You don‚Äôt need Effects to transform data for rendering.**
*   **You don‚Äôt need Effects to handle user events.**

For example, you don‚Äôt need an Effect to adjust some state based on other state:

    function Form() {const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('Taylor');const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('Swift');// üî¥ Avoid: redundant state and unnecessary Effectconst [fullName, setFullName] = useState('');useEffect(() => {setFullName(firstName + ' ' + lastName);}, [firstName, lastName]);// ...}

Instead, calculate as much as you can while rendering:

    function Form() {const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('Taylor');const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('Swift');// ‚úÖ Good: calculated during renderingconst fullName = firstName + ' ' + lastName;// ...}

However, you _do_ need Effects to synchronize with external systems.

* * *

## Lifecycle of reactive effects[](#lifecycle-of-reactive-effects "Link for Lifecycle of reactive effects")

Effects have a different lifecycle from components. Components may mount, update, or unmount. An Effect can only do two things: to start synchronizing something, and later to stop synchronizing it. This cycle can happen multiple times if your Effect depends on props and state that change over time.

This Effect depends on the value of the `roomId` prop. Props are _reactive values,_ which means they can change on a re-render. Notice that the Effect _re-synchronizes_ (and re-connects to the server) if `roomId` changes:

import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { createConnection } from './chat.js';

const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';

function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  useEffect(() \=> {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () \=> connection.disconnect();
  }, \[roomId\]);

  return <h1\>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1\>;
}

export default function App() {
  const \[roomId, setRoomId\] = useState('general');
  return (
    <\>
      <label\>
        Choose the chat room:{' '}
        <select
          value\={roomId}
          onChange\={e \=> setRoomId(e.target.value)}
        \>
          <option value\="general"\>general</option\>
          <option value\="travel"\>travel</option\>
          <option value\="music"\>music</option\>
        </select\>
      </label\>
      <hr />
      <ChatRoom roomId\={roomId} />
    </\>
  );
}

React provides a linter rule to check that you‚Äôve specified your Effect‚Äôs dependencies correctly. If you forget to specify `roomId` in the list of dependencies in the above example, the linter will find that bug automatically.

## Separating events from Effects[](#separating-events-from-effects "Link for Separating events from Effects")

### Under Construction

This section describes an **experimental API that has not yet been released** in a stable version of React.

Event handlers only re-run when you perform the same interaction again. Unlike event handlers, Effects re-synchronize if any of the values they read, like props or state, are different than during last render. Sometimes, you want a mix of both behaviors: an Effect that re-runs in response to some values but not others.

All code inside Effects is _reactive._ It will run again if some reactive value it reads has changed due to a re-render. For example, this Effect will re-connect to the chat if either `roomId` or `theme` have changed:

import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { createConnection, sendMessage } from './chat.js';
import { showNotification } from './notifications.js';

const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';

function ChatRoom({ roomId, theme }) {
  useEffect(() \=> {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.on('connected', () \=> {
      showNotification('Connected!', theme);
    });
    connection.connect();
    return () \=> connection.disconnect();
  }, \[roomId, theme\]);

  return <h1\>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1\>
}

export default function App() {
  const \[roomId, setRoomId\] = useState('general');
  const \[isDark, setIsDark\] = useState(false);
  return (
    <\>
      <label\>
        Choose the chat room:{' '}
        <select
          value\={roomId}
          onChange\={e \=> setRoomId(e.target.value)}
        \>
          <option value\="general"\>general</option\>
          <option value\="travel"\>travel</option\>
          <option value\="music"\>music</option\>
        </select\>
      </label\>
      <label\>
        <input
          type\="checkbox"
          checked\={isDark}
          onChange\={e \=> setIsDark(e.target.checked)}
        />
        Use dark theme
      </label\>
      <hr />
      <ChatRoom
        roomId\={roomId}
        theme\={isDark ? 'dark' : 'light'} 
      />
    </\>
  );
}

This is not ideal. You want to re-connect to the chat only if the `roomId` has changed. Switching the `theme` shouldn‚Äôt re-connect to the chat! Move the code reading `theme` out of your Effect into an _Effect Event_:

import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { experimental\_useEffectEvent as useEffectEvent } from 'react';
import { createConnection, sendMessage } from './chat.js';
import { showNotification } from './notifications.js';

const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';

function ChatRoom({ roomId, theme }) {
  const onConnected = useEffectEvent(() \=> {
    showNotification('Connected!', theme);
  });

  useEffect(() \=> {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.on('connected', () \=> {
      onConnected();
    });
    connection.connect();
    return () \=> connection.disconnect();
  }, \[roomId\]);

  return <h1\>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1\>
}

export default function App() {
  const \[roomId, setRoomId\] = useState('general');
  const \[isDark, setIsDark\] = useState(false);
  return (
    <\>
      <label\>
        Choose the chat room:{' '}
        <select
          value\={roomId}
          onChange\={e \=> setRoomId(e.target.value)}
        \>
          <option value\="general"\>general</option\>
          <option value\="travel"\>travel</option\>
          <option value\="music"\>music</option\>
        </select\>
      </label\>
      <label\>
        <input
          type\="checkbox"
          checked\={isDark}
          onChange\={e \=> setIsDark(e.target.checked)}
        />
        Use dark theme
      </label\>
      <hr />
      <ChatRoom
        roomId\={roomId}
        theme\={isDark ? 'dark' : 'light'} 
      />
    </\>
  );
}

Code inside Effect Events isn‚Äôt reactive, so changing the `theme` no longer makes your Effect re-connect.

## Removing Effect dependencies[](#removing-effect-dependencies "Link for Removing Effect dependencies")

When you write an Effect, the linter will verify that you‚Äôve included every reactive value (like props and state) that the Effect reads in the list of your Effect‚Äôs dependencies. This ensures that your Effect remains synchronized with the latest props and state of your component. Unnecessary dependencies may cause your Effect to run too often, or even create an infinite loop. The way you remove them depends on the case.

For example, this Effect depends on the `options` object which gets re-created every time you edit the input:

import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { createConnection } from './chat.js';

const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';

function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const \[message, setMessage\] = useState('');

  const options = {
    serverUrl: serverUrl,
    roomId: roomId
  };

  useEffect(() \=> {
    const connection = createConnection(options);
    connection.connect();
    return () \=> connection.disconnect();
  }, \[options\]);

  return (
    <\>
      <h1\>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1\>
      <input value\={message} onChange\={e \=> setMessage(e.target.value)} />
    </\>
  );
}

export default function App() {
  const \[roomId, setRoomId\] = useState('general');
  return (
    <\>
      <label\>
        Choose the chat room:{' '}
        <select
          value\={roomId}
          onChange\={e \=> setRoomId(e.target.value)}
        \>
          <option value\="general"\>general</option\>
          <option value\="travel"\>travel</option\>
          <option value\="music"\>music</option\>
        </select\>
      </label\>
      <hr />
      <ChatRoom roomId\={roomId} />
    </\>
  );
}

You don‚Äôt want the chat to re-connect every time you start typing a message in that chat. To fix this problem, move creation of the `options` object inside the Effect so that the Effect only depends on the `roomId` string:

import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { createConnection } from './chat.js';

const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';

function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const \[message, setMessage\] = useState('');

  useEffect(() \=> {
    const options = {
      serverUrl: serverUrl,
      roomId: roomId
    };
    const connection = createConnection(options);
    connection.connect();
    return () \=> connection.disconnect();
  }, \[roomId\]);

  return (
    <\>
      <h1\>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1\>
      <input value\={message} onChange\={e \=> setMessage(e.target.value)} />
    </\>
  );
}

export default function App() {
  const \[roomId, setRoomId\] = useState('general');
  return (
    <\>
      <label\>
        Choose the chat room:{' '}
        <select
          value\={roomId}
          onChange\={e \=> setRoomId(e.target.value)}
        \>
          <option value\="general"\>general</option\>
          <option value\="travel"\>travel</option\>
          <option value\="music"\>music</option\>
        </select\>
      </label\>
      <hr />
      <ChatRoom roomId\={roomId} />
    </\>
  );
}

Notice that you didn‚Äôt start by editing the dependency list to remove the `options` dependency. That would be wrong. Instead, you changed the surrounding code so that the dependency became _unnecessary._ Think of the dependency list as a list of all the reactive values used by your Effect‚Äôs code. You don‚Äôt intentionally choose what to put on that list. The list describes your code. To change the dependency list, change the code.

## Reusing logic with custom Hooks[](#reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks "Link for Reusing logic with custom Hooks")

React comes with built-in Hooks like `useState`, `useContext`, and `useEffect`. Sometimes, you‚Äôll wish that there was a Hook for some more specific purpose: for example, to fetch data, to keep track of whether the user is online, or to connect to a chat room. To do this, you can create your own Hooks for your application‚Äôs needs.

In this example, the `usePointerPosition` custom Hook tracks the cursor position, while `useDelayedValue` custom Hook returns a value that‚Äôs ‚Äúlagging behind‚Äù the value you passed by a certain number of milliseconds. Move the cursor over the sandbox preview area to see a moving trail of dots following the cursor:

import { usePointerPosition } from './usePointerPosition.js';
import { useDelayedValue } from './useDelayedValue.js';

export default function Canvas() {
  const pos1 = usePointerPosition();
  const pos2 = useDelayedValue(pos1, 100);
  const pos3 = useDelayedValue(pos2, 200);
  const pos4 = useDelayedValue(pos3, 100);
  const pos5 = useDelayedValue(pos4, 50);
  return (
    <\>
      <Dot position\={pos1} opacity\={1} />
      <Dot position\={pos2} opacity\={0.8} />
      <Dot position\={pos3} opacity\={0.6} />
      <Dot position\={pos4} opacity\={0.4} />
      <Dot position\={pos5} opacity\={0.2} />
    </\>
  );
}

function Dot({ position, opacity }) {
  return (
    <div style\={{
      position: 'absolute',
      backgroundColor: 'pink',
      borderRadius: '50%',
      opacity,
      transform: \`translate(${position.x}px, ${position.y}px)\`,
      pointerEvents: 'none',
      left: -20,
      top: -20,
      width: 40,
      height: 40,
    }} />
  );
}

You can create custom Hooks, compose them together, pass data between them, and reuse them between components. As your app grows, you will write fewer Effects by hand because you‚Äôll be able to reuse custom Hooks you already wrote. There are also many excellent custom Hooks maintained by the React community.
