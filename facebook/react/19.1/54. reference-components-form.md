## Reference[](#reference "Link for Reference")

### `<form>`[](#form "Link for this heading")

To create interactive controls for submitting information, render the [built-in browser `<form>` component](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form).

    <form action={search}><input name="query" /><button type="submit">Search</button></form>

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Props[](#props "Link for Props")

`<form>` supports all [common element props.](about:/reference/react-dom/components/common#props)

[`action`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form#action): a URL or function. When a URL is passed to `action` the form will behave like the HTML form component. When a function is passed to `action` the function will handle the form submission. The function passed to `action` may be async and will be called with a single argument containing the [form data](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData) of the submitted form. The `action` prop can be overridden by a `formAction` attribute on a `<button>`, `<input type="submit">`, or `<input type="image">` component.

#### Caveats[](#caveats "Link for Caveats")

*   When a function is passed to `action` or `formAction` the HTTP method will be POST regardless of value of the `method` prop.

## Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage")

### Handle form submission on the client[](#handle-form-submission-on-the-client "Link for Handle form submission on the client")

Pass a function to the `action` prop of form to run the function when the form is submitted. [`formData`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData) will be passed to the function as an argument so you can access the data submitted by the form. This differs from the conventional [HTML action](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form#action), which only accepts URLs. After the `action` function succeeds, all uncontrolled field elements in the form are reset.

### Handle form submission with a Server Function[](#handle-form-submission-with-a-server-function "Link for Handle form submission with a Server Function")

Render a `<form>` with an input and submit button. Pass a Server Function (a function marked with [`'use server'`](/reference/rsc/use-server)) to the `action` prop of form to run the function when the form is submitted.

Passing a Server Function to `<form action>` allow users to submit forms without JavaScript enabled or before the code has loaded. This is beneficial to users who have a slow connection, device, or have JavaScript disabled and is similar to the way forms work when a URL is passed to the `action` prop.

You can use hidden form fields to provide data to the `<form>`’s action. The Server Function will be called with the hidden form field data as an instance of [`FormData`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData).

    import { updateCart } from './lib.js';function AddToCart({productId}) {async function addToCart(formData) {'use server'const productId = formData.get('productId')await updateCart(productId)}return (<form action={addToCart}><input type="hidden" name="productId" value={productId} /><button type="submit">Add to Cart</button></form>);}

In lieu of using hidden form fields to provide data to the `<form>`’s action, you can call the `bind` method to supply it with extra arguments. This will bind a new argument (`productId`) to the function in addition to the `formData` that is passed as an argument to the function.

    import { updateCart } from './lib.js';function AddToCart({productId}) {async function addToCart(productId, formData) {"use server";await updateCart(productId)}const addProductToCart = addToCart.bind(null, productId);return (<form action={addProductToCart}><button type="submit">Add to Cart</button></form>);}

When `<form>` is rendered by a [Server Component](/reference/rsc/use-client), and a [Server Function](/reference/rsc/server-functions) is passed to the `<form>`’s `action` prop, the form is [progressively enhanced](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement).

### Display a pending state during form submission[](#display-a-pending-state-during-form-submission "Link for Display a pending state during form submission")

To display a pending state when a form is being submitted, you can call the `useFormStatus` Hook in a component rendered in a `<form>` and read the `pending` property returned.

Here, we use the `pending` property to indicate the form is submitting.

import { useFormStatus } from "react-dom";
import { submitForm } from "./actions.js";

function Submit() {
  const { pending } = useFormStatus();
  return (
    <button type\="submit" disabled\={pending}\>
      {pending ? "Submitting..." : "Submit"}
    </button\>
  );
}

function Form({ action }) {
  return (
    <form action\={action}\>
      <Submit />
    </form\>
  );
}

export default function App() {
  return <Form action\={submitForm} />;
}

To learn more about the `useFormStatus` Hook see the [reference documentation](/reference/react-dom/hooks/useFormStatus).

### Optimistically updating form data[](#optimistically-updating-form-data "Link for Optimistically updating form data")

The `useOptimistic` Hook provides a way to optimistically update the user interface before a background operation, like a network request, completes. In the context of forms, this technique helps to make apps feel more responsive. When a user submits a form, instead of waiting for the server’s response to reflect the changes, the interface is immediately updated with the expected outcome.

For example, when a user types a message into the form and hits the “Send” button, the `useOptimistic` Hook allows the message to immediately appear in the list with a “Sending…” label, even before the message is actually sent to a server. This “optimistic” approach gives the impression of speed and responsiveness. The form then attempts to truly send the message in the background. Once the server confirms the message has been received, the “Sending…” label is removed.

import { useOptimistic, useState, useRef } from "react";
import { deliverMessage } from "./actions.js";

function Thread({ messages, sendMessage }) {
  const formRef = useRef();
  async function formAction(formData) {
    addOptimisticMessage(formData.get("message"));
    formRef.current.reset();
    await sendMessage(formData);
  }
  const \[optimisticMessages, addOptimisticMessage\] = useOptimistic(
    messages,
    (state, newMessage) \=> \[
      ...state,
      {
        text: newMessage,
        sending: true
      }
    \]
  );

  return (
    <\>
      {optimisticMessages.map((message, index) \=> (
        <div key\={index}\>
          {message.text}
          {!!message.sending && <small\> (Sending...)</small\>}
        </div\>
      ))}
      <form action\={formAction} ref\={formRef}\>
        <input type\="text" name\="message" placeholder\="Hello!" />
        <button type\="submit"\>Send</button\>
      </form\>
    </\>
  );
}

export default function App() {
  const \[messages, setMessages\] = useState(\[
    { text: "Hello there!", sending: false, key: 1 }
  \]);
  async function sendMessage(formData) {
    const sentMessage = await deliverMessage(formData.get("message"));
    setMessages((messages) \=> \[...messages, { text: sentMessage }\]);
  }
  return <Thread messages\={messages} sendMessage\={sendMessage} />;
}

### Handling form submission errors[](#handling-form-submission-errors "Link for Handling form submission errors")

In some cases the function called by a `<form>`’s `action` prop throws an error. You can handle these errors by wrapping `<form>` in an Error Boundary. If the function called by a `<form>`’s `action` prop throws an error, the fallback for the error boundary will be displayed.

import { ErrorBoundary } from "react-error-boundary";

export default function Search() {
  function search() {
    throw new Error("search error");
  }
  return (
    <ErrorBoundary
      fallback\={<p\>There was an error while submitting the form</p\>}
    \>
      <form action\={search}\>
        <input name\="query" />
        <button type\="submit"\>Search</button\>
      </form\>
    </ErrorBoundary\>
  );
}

### Display a form submission error without JavaScript[](#display-a-form-submission-error-without-javascript "Link for Display a form submission error without JavaScript")

Displaying a form submission error message before the JavaScript bundle loads for progressive enhancement requires that:

1.  `<form>` be rendered by a [Server Component](/reference/rsc/use-client)
2.  the function passed to the `<form>`’s `action` prop be a [Server Function](/reference/rsc/server-functions)
3.  the `useActionState` Hook be used to display the error message

`useActionState` takes two parameters: a [Server Function](/reference/rsc/server-functions) and an initial state. `useActionState` returns two values, a state variable and an action. The action returned by `useActionState` should be passed to the `action` prop of the form. The state variable returned by `useActionState` can be used to display an error message. The value returned by the Server Function passed to `useActionState` will be used to update the state variable.

import { useActionState } from "react";
import { signUpNewUser } from "./api";

export default function Page() {
  async function signup(prevState, formData) {
    "use server";
    const email = formData.get("email");
    try {
      await signUpNewUser(email);
      alert(\`Added "${email}"\`);
    } catch (err) {
      return err.toString();
    }
  }
  const \[message, signupAction\] = useActionState(signup, null);
  return (
    <\>
      <h1\>Signup for my newsletter</h1\>
      <p\>Signup with the same email twice to see an error</p\>
      <form action\={signupAction} id\="signup-form"\>
        <label htmlFor\="email"\>Email: </label\>
        <input name\="email" id\="email" placeholder\="react@example.com" />
        <button\>Sign up</button\>
        {!!message && <p\>{message}</p\>}
      </form\>
    </\>
  );
}

### Handling multiple submission types[](#handling-multiple-submission-types "Link for Handling multiple submission types")

Forms can be designed to handle multiple submission actions based on the button pressed by the user. Each button inside a form can be associated with a distinct action or behavior by setting the `formAction` prop.

When a user taps a specific button, the form is submitted, and a corresponding action, defined by that button’s attributes and action, is executed. For instance, a form might submit an article for review by default but have a separate button with `formAction` set to save the article as a draft.

export default function Search() {
  function publish(formData) {
    const content = formData.get("content");
    const button = formData.get("button");
    alert(\`'${content}' was published with the '${button}' button\`);
  }

  function save(formData) {
    const content = formData.get("content");
    alert(\`Your draft of '${content}' has been saved!\`);
  }

  return (
    <form action\={publish}\>
      <textarea name\="content" rows\={4} cols\={40} />
      <br />
      <button type\="submit" name\="button" value\="submit"\>Publish</button\>
      <button formAction\={save}\>Save draft</button\>
    </form\>
  );
}
