`prefetchDNS` lets you eagerly look up the IP of a server that you expect to load resources from.

    prefetchDNS("https://example.com");

To look up a host, call the `prefetchDNS` function from `react-dom`.

The prefetchDNS function provides the browser with a hint that it should look up the IP address of a given server. If the browser chooses to do so, this can speed up the loading of resources from that server.

`prefetchDNS` returns nothing.

Call `prefetchDNS` when rendering a component if you know that its children will load external resources from that host.

Call `prefetchDNS` in an event handler before transitioning to a page or state where external resources will be needed. This gets the process started earlier than if you call it during the rendering of the new page or state.
