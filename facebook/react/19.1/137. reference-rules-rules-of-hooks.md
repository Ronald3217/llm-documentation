Hooks are defined using JavaScript functions, but they represent a special type of reusable UI logic with restrictions on where they can be called.

**Donâ€™t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, nested functions, or `try`/`catch`/`finally` blocks.** Instead, always use Hooks at the top level of your React function, before any early returns. You can only call Hooks while React is rendering a function component:

Itâ€™s **not** supported to call Hooks (functions starting with `use`) in any other cases, for example:

If you break these rules, you might see this error.

    function Bad({ cond }) {if (cond) {// ðŸ”´ Bad: inside a condition (to fix, move it outside!)const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);}// ...}function Bad() {for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {// ðŸ”´ Bad: inside a loop (to fix, move it outside!)const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);}// ...}function Bad({ cond }) {if (cond) {return;}// ðŸ”´ Bad: after a conditional return (to fix, move it before the return!)const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);// ...}function Bad() {function handleClick() {// ðŸ”´ Bad: inside an event handler (to fix, move it outside!)const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);}// ...}function Bad() {const style = useMemo(() => {// ðŸ”´ Bad: inside useMemo (to fix, move it outside!)const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);return createStyle(theme);});// ...}class Bad extends React.Component {render() {// ðŸ”´ Bad: inside a class component (to fix, write a function component instead of a class!)useEffect(() => {})// ...}}function Bad() {try {// ðŸ”´ Bad: inside try/catch/finally block (to fix, move it outside!)const [x, setX] = useState(0);} catch {const [x, setX] = useState(1);}}

### Note

[Custom Hooks](/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks) _may_ call other Hooks (thatâ€™s their whole purpose). This works because custom Hooks are also supposed to only be called while a function component is rendering.

Donâ€™t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions. Instead, you can:

By following this rule, you ensure that all stateful logic in a component is clearly visible from its source code.
