## Legacy APIs[](#legacy-apis "Link for Legacy APIs")

*   [`Children`](/reference/react/Children) lets you manipulate and transform the JSX received as the `children` prop. [See alternatives.](about:/reference/react/Children#alternatives)
*   [`cloneElement`](/reference/react/cloneElement) lets you create a React element using another element as a starting point. [See alternatives.](about:/reference/react/cloneElement#alternatives)
*   [`Component`](/reference/react/Component) lets you define a React component as a JavaScript class. [See alternatives.](about:/reference/react/Component#alternatives)
*   [`createElement`](/reference/react/createElement) lets you create a React element. Typically, youâ€™ll use JSX instead.
*   [`createRef`](/reference/react/createRef) creates a ref object which can contain arbitrary value. [See alternatives.](about:/reference/react/createRef#alternatives)
*   [`forwardRef`](/reference/react/forwardRef) lets your component expose a DOM node to parent component with a [ref.](/learn/manipulating-the-dom-with-refs)
*   [`isValidElement`](/reference/react/isValidElement) checks whether a value is a React element. Typically used with [`cloneElement`.](/reference/react/cloneElement)
*   [`PureComponent`](/reference/react/PureComponent) is similar to [`Component`,](/reference/react/Component) but it skip re-renders with same props. [See alternatives.](about:/reference/react/PureComponent#alternatives)
