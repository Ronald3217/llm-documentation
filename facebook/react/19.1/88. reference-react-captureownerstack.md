## Reference[](#reference "Link for Reference")

### `captureOwnerStack()`[](#captureownerstack "Link for this heading")

Call `captureOwnerStack` to get the current Owner Stack.

    import * as React from 'react';function Component() {if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {const ownerStack = React.captureOwnerStack();console.log(ownerStack);}}

#### Parameters[](#parameters "Link for Parameters")

`captureOwnerStack` does not take any parameters.

#### Returns[](#returns "Link for Returns")

`captureOwnerStack` returns `string | null`.

Owner Stacks are available in

*   Component render
*   Effects (e.g. `useEffect`)
*   React’s event handlers (e.g. `<button onClick={...} />`)
*   React error handlers ([React Root options](about:/reference/react-dom/client/createRoot#parameters) `onCaughtError`, `onRecoverableError`, and `onUncaughtError`)

If no Owner Stack is available, `null` is returned (see [Troubleshooting: The Owner Stack is `null`](#the-owner-stack-is-null)).

#### Caveats[](#caveats "Link for Caveats")

*   Owner Stacks are only available in development. `captureOwnerStack` will always return `null` outside of development.

##### Deep Dive

#### Owner Stack vs Component Stack[](#owner-stack-vs-component-stack "Link for Owner Stack vs Component Stack")

The Owner Stack is different from the Component Stack available in React error handlers like [`errorInfo.componentStack` in `onUncaughtError`](about:/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot#show-a-dialog-for-uncaught-errors).

For example, consider the following code:

import {captureOwnerStack} from 'react';
import {createRoot} from 'react-dom/client';
import App, {Component} from './App.js';
import './styles.css';

createRoot(document.createElement('div'), {
  onUncaughtError: (error, errorInfo) \=> {
    
    
    
    
    
    console.log(errorInfo.componentStack);
    console.log(captureOwnerStack());
  },
}).render(
  <App\>
    <Component label\="disabled" />
  </App\>
);

`SubComponent` would throw an error. The Component Stack of that error would be

    at SubComponentat fieldsetat Componentat mainat React.Suspenseat App

However, the Owner Stack would only read

    at Component

Neither `App` nor the DOM components (e.g. `fieldset`) are considered Owners in this Stack since they didn’t contribute to “creating” the node containing `SubComponent`. `App` and DOM components only forwarded the node. `App` just rendered the `children` node as opposed to `Component` which created a node containing `SubComponent` via `<SubComponent />`.

Neither `Navigation` nor `legend` are in the stack at all since it’s only a sibling to a node containing `<SubComponent />`.

`SubComponent` is omitted because it’s already part of the callstack.

## Usage[](#usage "Link for Usage")

### Enhance a custom error overlay[](#enhance-a-custom-error-overlay "Link for Enhance a custom error overlay")

    import { captureOwnerStack } from "react";import { instrumentedConsoleError } from "./errorOverlay";const originalConsoleError = console.error;console.error = function patchedConsoleError(...args) {originalConsoleError.apply(console, args);const ownerStack = captureOwnerStack();onConsoleError({// Keep in mind that in a real application, console.error can be// called with multiple arguments which you should account for.consoleMessage: args[0],ownerStack,});};

If you intercept `console.error` calls to highlight them in an error overlay, you can call `captureOwnerStack` to include the Owner Stack.

import { captureOwnerStack } from "react";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import App from './App';
import { onConsoleError } from "./errorOverlay";
import './styles.css';

const originalConsoleError = console.error;
console.error = function patchedConsoleError(...args) {
  originalConsoleError.apply(console, args);
  const ownerStack = captureOwnerStack();
  onConsoleError({
    
    
    consoleMessage: args\[0\],
    ownerStack,
  });
};

const container = document.getElementById("root");
createRoot(container).render(<App />);

## Troubleshooting[](#troubleshooting "Link for Troubleshooting")

### The Owner Stack is `null`[](#the-owner-stack-is-null "Link for this heading")

The call of `captureOwnerStack` happened outside of a React controlled function e.g. in a `setTimeout` callback, after a `fetch` call or in a custom DOM event handler. During render, Effects, React event handlers, and React error handlers (e.g. `hydrateRoot#options.onCaughtError`) Owner Stacks should be available.

In the example below, clicking the button will log an empty Owner Stack because `captureOwnerStack` was called during a custom DOM event handler. The Owner Stack must be captured earlier e.g. by moving the call of `captureOwnerStack` into the Effect body.

import {captureOwnerStack, useEffect} from 'react';

export default function App() {
  useEffect(() \=> {
    
    function handleEvent() {
      
      
      console.log('Owner Stack: ', captureOwnerStack());
    }

    document.addEventListener('click', handleEvent);

    return () \=> {
      document.removeEventListener('click', handleEvent);
    }
  })

  return <button\>Click me to see that Owner Stacks are not available in custom DOM event handlers</button\>;
}

### `captureOwnerStack` is not available[](#captureownerstack-is-not-available "Link for this heading")

`captureOwnerStack` is only exported in development builds. It will be `undefined` in production builds. If `captureOwnerStack` is used in files that are bundled for production and development, you should conditionally access it from a namespace import.

    // Don't use named imports of `captureOwnerStack` in files that are bundled for development and production.import {captureOwnerStack} from 'react';// Use a namespace import instead and access `captureOwnerStack` conditionally.import * as React from 'react';if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {const ownerStack = React.captureOwnerStack();console.log('Owner Stack', ownerStack);}
